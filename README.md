# .glzr

This is my personal configuration for [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) and [Zebar](https://github.com/glzr-io/zebar).

[`zebar/nullgato`](https://github.com/nullgato/.glzr/zebar/nullgato) contains my custom written Zebar components using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
